Note that only Trainwreck, Convoy, CaptureFlag have bots.

For Nigerian Prince Mission, you will need go in the code and change the required item, currently it is set to one gold bar.  note that it cannot count currency in stacks, so if you want a $1000 in trader currency, you will need to specify that item, and say they must place them individually in the bag.
